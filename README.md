<p align="center"><i>An automatic random testing suite for Scylla and Apache Cassandra.</i></p>

## How does Gemini work?

Gemini operates on two clusters, a system under test (SUT) and a test oracle, by generating random mutations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`) and verifying them (`SELECT`) using the CQL protocol and query language. As the mutations are performed on both systems, their client-visible state is assumed to be the same, unless either of the systems (usually system under test) have bugs. If a verification step fails, Gemini reports the CQL query and its results for further analysis.

## Getting started with Gemini

### TLDR: Running with default arguments

1. Download a release from http://downloads.scylladb.com/gemini/

2. Make sure you have two scylla clusters setup from here on referred to as ORACLE_CLUSTER and TEST_CLUSTER

3. Unzip the tarball and run `./gemini --oracle-cluster=<ORACLE_CLUSTER> --test-cluster=<TEST_CLUSTER>`

Enjoy!

### Further CLI arguments

Execute `./gemini --help` to see the entire list of arguments available.
Their explanation in some detail is available the [CLI arguments](cli-arguments.md).
